Establish a Question-Answer System using the Large Language Model (LLM) using the database Tripadvisor Hotel Review

# Objective

Our goal is to establish a Question-Answer System using the Large Language Model (LLM). 
We will utilize documents extracted from "Tripadvisor Hotel Reviews" to feed the LLM (OpenAI-GPT). 
First, we will examine its information, clean the review column, and then save the clean database as a CSV file. 
Then, we will connect a database to the LLM, aiming to construct a Question-Answer System. 
This system is intended to offer pertinent answers to specific business-related inquiries.
